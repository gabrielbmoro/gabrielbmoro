Hi, My name's Gabriel, you can call me just Moro.

## Personal Repositories

- [MovieDB - Android](https://github.com/gabrielbmoro/MovieDB-Android)

- [Crazy Math - Android](https://github.com/gabrielbmoro/CrazyMath-Android)

  CrazyMath is a project for children to practice mathematics as the game. I thought this Idea when I remember of Cross-words, but I change it to be a kind of Cross-numbers game.
