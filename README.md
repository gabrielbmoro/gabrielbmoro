## About Me

As a Mobile Engineer and team leader, I mentor developers, lead proof of concepts for complex features, and work hands-on with modern APIs. Since 2017, Iâ€™ve been part of the software industry, collaborating with various companies and technologies within the mobile development ecosystem, with a strong focus on Android, Flutter, and Kotlin Multiplatform.

Iâ€™m passionate about sharing knowledge and giving back to the community. Iâ€™ve written articles on Mobile development topics â€” including code reviews, navigation, and testing. Iâ€™m also an active member and content creator at CodandoTV, a tech community where I produce video content about Mobile development. Additionally, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to speak at local tech events, including GDG Groups and GDG DevFest, sharing insights and experiences with fellow developers.
