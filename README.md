# Hello, I'm Gabriel Bronzatti Moro 👋🚀

README em Português 🇧🇷 [aqui](README_ptBr.md)

I'm also known as **Moro** or **gabrielbmoro**.

## About Me

I am a **Mobile Application Developer**. Since **2017**, I’ve been working in the software industry, collaborating with multiple companies and technologies across the mobile development ecosystem.

I’m currently a **Senior Mobile Application Developer** at Ambush.

My responsibilities include **mentoring developers**, **leading proof of concept (POC) initiatives** for complex features, and working directly with modern APIs. My technical focus spans **Android** 🤖, **Flutter** 💙, and **Kotlin Multiplatform**.

Recently, I’ve dedicated my studies to **Flutter**, aiming to sharpen my skills by contributing to open-source projects such as the [TodoApp](https://github.com/CodandoTV/todoapp_flutter), [JujubaSVG](https://github.com/CodandoTV/jujubaSVG), and [Eagle Eye](https://github.com/CodandoTV/eagle-eye).

## Community & Content 🎤

I’m passionate about **sharing knowledge** and giving back to the community.

- I'm an **active member and content creator at [CodandoTV](https://www.youtube.com/@CodandoTV)**, a tech community where I produce **video content on mobile development**.

- I’m also an **article author**, writing about mobile development topics such as code review, navigation, and testing.

- I’ve had the opportunity to speak at local tech events like **GDG Groups** and **GDG DevFest**, where I shared insights and experiences with other developers.

## My Open Source Projects 💻

I’m a contributor/author of several open-source projects, many of them under the [CodandoTV](https://github.com/CodandoTV) organization.

### 🎬 [MovieDB-App](https://github.com/gabrielbmoro/MovieDB-App)

An **Compose Multiplatform** app that lists movies using the Movie DB API, allowing users to browse the most popular and top-rated movies.

- **Stack:** Uses Koin for dependency injection, Ktor for network requests, and the Popcorn Guineapig plugin for module analysis.

### 🍿🐹 [Popcorn Guinea pig](https://github.com/CodandoTV/popcorn-guineapig)

A gradle library designed to **enforce architectural rules** in multi-module projects in a simple way. It supports **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)**, **Java Projects**, and **Android Projects**.

### 🎨 [JujubaSVG](https://github.com/CodandoTV/jujubaSVG)

A friendly library to **manipulate SVG files** in **Android** and **Flutter** apps. It allows accessing any SVG element by its ID to modify properties such as background color or stroke.

### 🦅 [EagleEye](https://github.com/CodandoTV/eagle-eye)

A **Dart CLI tool** designed to **detect architectural violations** and enforce rules in Flutter/Dart projects. It identifies forbidden dependencies based on patterns configured in an `eagle_eye_config.json` file.

### Other Projects

- **[HTTP Guinea pigs code](https://gabrielbmoro.github.io/httpguineapigscode/):** A fun project mapping HTTP codes to guinea pigs.

- **[TodoApp](https://github.com/CodandoTV/todoapp_flutter):** A sample **Flutter** project and CodandoTV template, serving as a playground for experimenting with different features and implementations. Its stack includes Freezed for data classes, `get_it` for dependency injection, and AutoRoute for navigation.
